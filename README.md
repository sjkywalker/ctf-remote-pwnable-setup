# CTF Pwnables Setup Automation Script

These are shell scripts that automate some procedures shown [here](https://github.com/pwning/docs/blob/master/suggestions-for-running-a-ctf.markdown). These scripts are helpful when adding remote problems in pwnable ctf server.

## Getting started

### Overview

* makeprob.sh
* removeprob.sh
* dropprob.sh
* reloadprob.sh

### Environment

```bash
user@ubuntu:~/send_arp$ uname -a
Linux ubuntu 4.15.0-30-generic #32~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jul 26 20:25:39 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

## Running the program

### Build

They are all shell scripts (bash). No need to build!

You might want to remove the `.sh` extension so that scripts can be executed just like any other command.

### Run

Formats are specified in each file.

You need root priviledges to run all four scripts because they can cause fatal issues in your directory tree.

* *makeprob.sh will create a default executble and flag. Replace those with your own ones*
* *When you want to keep the problem but off the port, use dropprob.sh*
* *To re-run a dropped problem on a specific port, use reloadprob.sh*
* *removeprob.sh to delete everything related to a problem from the server*
